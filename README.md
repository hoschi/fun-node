 * zombie.js

	Simple zombie test to play with it. Found out that runScipts=true cause a lot of errors.

 * vows-test.js

	Play around with vows to see how tests look with it (and zombie.js). But I found it to confusing.

 * vows-ctest.coffee

	Play with coffeescript and look if it can make vows tests look more clear -> don't
